1  What is ELLA ?
   ______________

1.1 Introduction

ELLA is a hardware design language and supporting software system
comprising a compiler, design library manager, transformational system,
public interface and simulator.  ELLA was developed at DRA Malvern
(formerly the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment) over a fourteen
year period up to 1993.  The ELLA language was developed specifically to
support the *design* of digital hardware (unlike VHDL, the US VHSIC
Hardware Design Language, which was primarily designed for *modelling*
hardware).   The aim of the ELLA project was to apply some of the
lessons learnt from software languages to hardware, especially to
support higher levels of abstraction.  The ELLA system is capable of
modelling a wide range of levels of abstraction from systems level down
to gate level.  Formal semantics for the ELLA language are being
developed at the Universities of Manchester, Cambridge and Edinburgh,
and algebraic laws for ELLA at DRA Malvern.

The ELLA language has been designed to be simple to learn - its
underlying model is that of a fully concurrent (data-flow) network - so
it has intuitive appeal to hardware engineers used to thinking in
parallel.  The language is strongly typed with user defined types.  All
expressions are implicitly typed allowing an easy to read and reasonably
compact notation.  The primary building blocks in the language are CASE
expressions (a generalised multiplexor), DELAYs which introduce timing,
and functions to define hierarchy and to permit reusability.  The design
library manager, or "EASE" - the ELLA Application Support Environment,
supports modular compilation and multi-level simulation. Its system of
"contexts" allows easy partitioning and configuration of circuit
designs.

Work at the Defence Research Agency on developing ELLA as a hardware
design lanaguage has now finished with the definition of the "ELLA 2000"
version of the language and an implementation of the supporting
software.  ELLA 2000 has a number of powerful extentions to the earlier
ELLA language.  References to "ELLA" in the rest of this document refer
to the ELLA 2000 version.  A commercialised version of the earlier ELLA
system, developed by Praxis Systems (Bath, UK) and now supported by
R-cube Systems (Bath, UK), has been in wide spread use within major UK
electronics companies.  ELLA has been used mainly for VLSI circuit
design, often in conjunction with the LOCAM synthesis tools developed by
Philips.  Use of the ELLA product by industry has been affected by the
adoption of VHDL as an IEEE standard and by the improved support for
VHDL by commercial tools vendors. There is now the prospect of the ELLA
2000 book and the public domain software generating fresh interest in
ELLA as a non-proprietary system.

1.2 Public Domain ELLA

There are many features in the ELLA language that make it very well
suited to hardware design.  The UK Ministry of Defence has given
permission for the definition of the ELLA language and the DRA ELLA
System software to be made available for study purposes.  It is expected
that, by giving ready access to the ELLA System, the ideas contained in
it will influence the future development of hardware description
languages.  The ELLA transformation system in particular has been shown
to be an effective front-end for circuit synthesis allowing high-level
ELLA designs to be worked through to gate level.  ELLA is suited to
applications in formal methods because of its simple well defined
semantics.  The release of a public domain version of the ELLA software
was timed to coincide with the publication of the ELLA book.  The
software is supplied as Sun binaries and includes a simulator that supports
the full ELLA 2000 language.  This simulator does not include all the
diagnostic and support commands available in the commercial version.

Public domain ELLA software is offered as a binary image for Sun SPARC 2,
SPARC 5 and Sun SPARC 10 workstations running the SunOS 4.1.3 version of the
operating system (ELLA will also work under Solaris but there may be
some compatibility problems).  The latest release of the ELLA software may
be obtained by using the internet ftp server at DRA Malvern, UK from the
directory ftp.dra.hmg.gb:ella.

No commitment can be made by the DRA as to whether or not further releases
will take place.  Enquiries about support for ELLA System software or about
the commercial versions of ELLA should be made to R-cube Systems Limited
whose address is given below.

This release contains an update of the release made in November 1993, a
language mapping system (schema mapping), a definition of the ELLA open
interface, the sources and build tools used to construct the ELLA images
and an ELLA prover, (no sources with this).

3.1  Release directory

The release directory on the ftp server at DRA Malvern contains the following:


_____________________ An update on the original release _______________________


README          - this file
Release-notes   - notes about this release, and known bug descriptions.
ella.gz         - a compressed binary of the ELLA system
                  (without simulator)
ellasim.gz      - a compressed binary of the ELLA simulator
install.tar.gz  - a compressed tar file containing
                     a directory of ELLA examples called examples,
                     a directory for verifying the system called verify,
                     a directory containing the documentation including
                         user documentation
                           and others.
                     a setup script file,
                     a usage logging file.

The directory of examples also contains the standard ELLA numerical
library and ELLA source and input files for the verification process.

Additional image file:-

ellatransform.gz - A demonstration of external transformations.

______________________ The schema mapping environment _________________________

generator.gz     - The schema generator program.
schemamenu.gz    - The schema mapping environment.

The schema mapping system is a system for doing mappings within a language
or between languages.  A schema is a notation for describing the internal
structure of a language.

generator
---------

The generator program takes a schema describing a language and generates
the files needed to write mapping utilities.

For more information see documents in directory doc

schemagen.usm       --  The Schema Generator User Manual.
ella_schema.txt     --  A description of the ELLA schema. This defines
                        the ELLA open interface.
layout_schema.txt   --  A description of the layout schema.
ella_vhdl.txt:      --  A description of the mappings of ELLA onto VHDL.


schemamenu 
----------

The schemamenu program gives access to some of the mappings which have been
written using the schema mapping system.  This includes the ELLA-VHDL
translator.

For more information see documents in directory doc

schemamap.usm   -- The Schema Mapping user manual.  Helps you write new
                   mapping utilities.
ella_vhdl.txt   -- A description of the mappings to translate ELLA to VHDL

____________________________ The build tool images ____________________________

a68toc.gz        - The ALGOL68 to C translator.
mm.gz            - The ALGOL68 compilation environment.

The program a68toc is used to generate C source files from the ALGOL68
source files (.a68).  There are several relevant documentation files in
directory doc:-

   a68toc.1        A manual file for use with the man facility.
   ctrans.texi     A Latex macro format file describing the translator.
   rscompiler.texi A description of the syntax parser of the ALGOL68 RS
                   compiler.  This is common to several implementations
                   of ALGOL68 systems.
   texinfo.tex     This is meant to be the macro definitions needed for the
                   .texi files.

*** NOTE ***

I am having difficulty running these latex files on our system, perhaps
someone with more knowledge of Latex than me can manage to sort them out.
In case these Latex files cannot be sorted out I have also included the
relevant PostScript (.ps) files which I believe correspond to the Latex.
However I have modified the ctrans.texi file, which means that the ctrans.ps
is out of date. The modifications occur in the Appendix A.1 and apply to
options -noline (-n) which should read:-

   Causes the generation of C pre-processor #line directives. In its absence
   the option -verbose causes comments containing Algol 68 line number and
   source file to be generated.

and -return_structs (-r) which should read:-

    Prevents generated C functions from returning structure results directly,
    it uses an extra pointer parameter instead.

there is also an additional option:-

-f <num>

   Truncates module names to <num> characters long when searching for USE
   and library modules. eg. -f 8 for DOS FAT files.

The man file a68toc.1 has been updated to reflect these changes.

*** End of NOTE ***

The program  mm  is an environment for compiling and linking ALGOL68
programs.  There is documentation about it in the directory doc.

   mmuserdoc.txt   This is documentation about the program mm.  It is
                   aimed very much on enabling anyone brave enough to have
                   a go, to make changes to the ELLA system.  It has a wider
                   scope and can be used for building any program using
                   multiple ALGOL68 modules.  Not all features of the
                   environment are documented due to lack of time. However
                   there is a simple help system supplied.

_______________________________________________________________________________


3.2  Installation of images and documentation etc.

1)  Create a suitable directory to hold the ELLA system files and copy
    the README, Release-notes and *.gz files into this directory, set
    binary mode in "ftp" for the .gz files.  You can omit a68toc.gz and
    mm.gz if you do not expect to be using the build tools.

2)  Unpack the release using the GNU compression utility "gzip" with -d
    option followed by "tar" on the install.tar file, this will create the
    directories examples, verify and doc. The ELLA user documentation,
    userdoc.txt, and other documentation is in the directory doc. Also in
    the tar file are a script file setup-ella and the ELLA logging file
    usage.log.

3)  Tailor the setup script to suit your working environment and arrange
    for the setup script to be obeyed for each user who requires access
    to the ELLA system.  Further details are contained in the script
    file.  Ensure that the image files ella and ellasim etc. have execute
    access.

4)  Run the tests to verify that the ELLA System works, to see how to do
    this read the script file verify/testella.  As well as the resources
    indicated below you will need about 600Kbytes of disk space for
    running the tests.  The directories verify and examples and the file
    usage.log must reside in the same directory. The image files, ella
    ellasim and schemamenu must be in the directory specified by the
    environment variable ELLASYSDIR which is defined in setup-ella.

5)  Buy a copy of the ELLA book and read the Release-notes file.

You are invited to E-mail to the ELLA Office (address below), giving
your name and address, so that you can be notified of any subsequent
developments.  However resources for maintaining the ELLA office are now
very limited and we can give no commitment to respond to enquiries.


3.3  Environment

The ELLA System has been built using the GNU C compiler, version 2.6.3,
to run on Sun SPARC 2, sun SPARC 5 and Sun SPARC 10 workstations running
the SunOS 4.1.3 version of the operating system, (there have been problems
running on Sparc 10 machines with any level of optimisation so the images
are compiled without optimisation).

ELLA will run under Solaris but there are some compatibility problems
relating to signal handling.  The release directory contains approximately
17 Mbytes in total.  However the files necessary for running the ELLA
system come to about 2.6 Mbytes.
 
The ELLA binary decompresses to 4.4 Mbytes (compiled without debug) and the
simulator to about 3.0 Mbytes. The ELLA System makes use of a statistical
garbage collector to manage heap memory resources.  The amount of memory
required to run ELLA depends on the size of ELLA description being processed.
The performance of the ELLA System will degrade if insufficient real memory
is available - 8 Mbytes is a minimum practical requirement.  Extremely
large commercial circuit descriptions have been known to require in excess
of 100 Mbytes of virtual memory when simulating.

3.4  Sources etc.

The ELLA system is divided up into a number of areas with a directory tree
for each area.  The release directory contains one tar (.tar) file for each
area. Except for the prover, which is an entity on its own, the list given
above is in order of precidence. Unless you wish to have a go at developing
on a PC you will not need to use i386emx.  Each area contains a README file
which details the files expected, dependancies and the rebuild teqhnique.

To unpack the tar files create a working directory and go into it. Copy the
required tar files into the working directory and unpack them with

    tar -xvf <filename.tar>

This will create a directory with the same basename as the tar file, and
within this the necessary directories and files for that particular area.
The tar file can now be deleted.

Each directory will need recursive un-zipping using gzip -d :-

   gzip -dvr *

To save space it may be better to do each tar file individually.

eg. if you have are in a directory /home/mydir and have a file osif.tar
    This will unpack to a directory osif which contains a number of 
    control files and the sub directories a68files bin cfiles mfiles,
    which contain the necessary source files.  See the document mmuserdoc.txt
    to find out how to compile and link ALGOL68 programs.

4  Support
   _______

The DRA is not empowered to offer a support service for ELLA.  It is
recommended that users make maximum use of the ELLA book and the
documentation supplied with the ELLA System.  Where bugs are suspected,
or deficiencies in the documentation are found, users are invited to send
an Email message to the ELLA office - address below.  However resources for
maintaining the ELLA office are now very limited and we can give no
commitment to respond to bug reports.

R-cube Systems Limited have a licence to support a commercial version of
the ELLA System.  Depending upon demand and the level of service
required, R-cube may be able to offer a support service for PD ELLA
software for an appropriate fee.  This may range from telephone help and
the supply or installation of a version of PD ELLA software on tape
through to a full support service and access to the full commercial
simulator.  Users are invited to contact R-cube Systems for further
information.
