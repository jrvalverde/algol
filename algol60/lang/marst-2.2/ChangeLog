        * Version 2.2 released.

        * marst.c
        Serious bug was fixed due to bug report provided by Paulo
        Barreto <paulo.barreto@terra.com.br>.

        The error occured because of incorrect passing a formal
        parameter called by name to other procedure. The MARST
        translator *incorrectly* treated a procedure statement like
        foo(..., bar, ...), where `bar' is a formal parameter called
        by name, as if it would be foo(..., (bar), ...), i.e. as if
        the value of `bar' would be passed, not the name. Therefore
        assignment to the corresponding formal parameter inside the
        procedure `foo' was impossible. In order to fix this bug a
        program fragment was added to the `actual_parameter' routine.

        * ex/a232.alg, ex/tennent.alg
        These two additional examples were added to the package. Due
        to the first example program a serious bug (see notice above)
        was found in MARST 2.1.

        * Version 2.1 released.

        * macvt.c
        Minor bug was fixed due to bug report provided by Bernhard
        Treutwein <Bernhard.Treutwein@Verwaltung.Uni-Muenchen.DE>
        (because of this bug the macvt converter incorrectly processed
        --ignore-case command line option)

        GNU MARST User's Guide is included into the distribution in
        texinfo (source), info, ps, pdf, and html formats.

        * Version 2.0 released.

        * marst.c
        Parsing implemented in the translator was fully re-programmed
        to continue translation in spite of syntax and semantic errors.
        In version 1.0 the translator had got an inborn defect (not a
        bug): it stopped on the first error found.

        * macvt.c
        Minor changes were made.

        * configure.in
        * Makefile.in
        Minor changes were made due to patches provided by Alexandre
        Oliva <oliva@lsd.ic.unicamp.br>.

        * Version 1.0 released under GNU Coding Standards.
