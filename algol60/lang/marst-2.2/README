GNU MARST package includes three components:

* the translator, MARST, that translates Algol 60 programs to the C
  programming language;

* the library, ALGLIB, that contains pre-compiled standard Algol 60
  procedures and additional library routines. This library is used at
  linking stage. (In this distribution the name 'libalgol.a' is used
  for the library file.);

* the converter, MACVT, that allows to convert existing Algol 60
  programs from some other representation to MARST representation.

The input language of the translator is hardware representation of full
(i.e. Level 0) Algol 60 as described in IFIP document:

Modified Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60, The Computer
Journal, v.19, No.4, Nov. 1976, pp.364-79. (This document is an official
standard IFIP document. It is *not* a part of the MARST package.)

Note that there are some differences between the Revised Report and the
Modified Report since the latter is a result of application of the
following IFIP document to the Revised Report:

R.M.De Morgan, I.D.Hill, and B.A.Wichmann. A Supplement to the ALGOL 60
Revised Report. The Computer Journal, Vol. 19, No. 3, 1976, pp. 276-88.
(This document is an official standard IFIP document. It is *not* a part
of the MARST package.)

The translator and all library routines are written in a basic dialect
of the C programming language which is a subset of ISO C as described in
preliminary ISO document (this dialect is practically the same as widely
known 1989' ANSI C):

ISO, Programming languages - C, WG14/N843, Commitee Draft - August 3,
1998. (This document is an official standard ISO document. It is *not* a
part of the MARST package.)

The output code produced by the translator is on the same dialect.
