# algol
Some very, very old ALGOL source code 

algol60 was the first computer language I learnt, long, long ago, closely followed by COBOL, FORTRAN IV an C.

Afterwards the list of languages grew very fast (Pascal, PL-I, Modula-2, Logo, Forth, etc...) and the list of
variantes, even faster.

But this repo only deals with Algol.
